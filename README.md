## TERE

**TERE** is short for **Tetris Revisited** and was a term project for my Software Development 2 class at The University of Agder during the fall semester of 2017. 

Our goal was to create a Tetris clone that would be close to the Nintendo GameBoy and NES versions from the late 1980s. We wanted to include a computer opponent so it would be possible to have competition even when playing alone, and making it as challenging as possible. We discussed whether we should have local- or network-based multiplayer, and initially decided that we would aim for networkbased. The inclusion of power-ups, as well as various visual effects were other initial goals that were discussed.

Setup instructions will come at a later point.
